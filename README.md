ROC curve


# Description

 
 Write a short report evaluating whether the review text can be used to (i) predict the review polarity (where a game has been “voted up” or not by the reviewer) and (ii) predict whether the review is for an “early access” version of a game or not. Hint: Select two or three machine learning approaches, apply them to the dataset and critically evaluate their classification performance. Remember its v important to clearly explain/justify any design choices that you make and any conclusions you arrive at. Include any code you use in an appendix. 
 
 (i) What are under-fitting and over-fitting, give an example of each.
 (ii) Give pseudo-code implementing k-fold cross-validation.
 (iii) Why does k-fold cross-validation provide a way to select a model hyperparameter so as to strike a balance    
       between over/under-fitting. 
 (iv) Discuss three pros and cons of a logistic regression classifier vs a kNN classifier. 
 (v) Give two examples of situations when a kNN classifier would give inaccurate predictions. Explain your reasoning.
